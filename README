Rift Guild Roster HTML generator

License: MIT (see LICENSE)
sorttable.js from http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/ (also MIT)

See example.png for an example of what it looks like.

Requires: Perl, XML::LibXML, Date::Parse, and CGI::Compress::Gzip 
 Change both mentions of CGI::Compress::Gzip to just CGI if you do not have or
 want compressed output. This also may be required to debug it if it's not 
 working.
Requires a Web server set up to run Perl scripts as CGI and to look for 
 'index.pl' as an index page.
Place the files in a folder served by your Web server. 
The folder must be writable by the Web server user for caching to work (!).

To regenerate based on new info, just upload a new guild.xml and refresh the 
 page in your browser.

Facilities for uploading via a form or for multiple guilds in the same folder
 are not provided in this version.
